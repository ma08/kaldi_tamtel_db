The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 21.4% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 83.3% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 6.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 113.7 hours of data, or 89.4 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 4.1% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (13,21.7,68)
