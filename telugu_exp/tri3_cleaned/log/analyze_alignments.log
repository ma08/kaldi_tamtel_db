The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 20.7% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 83.5% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 5.5% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 37.9 hours of data, or 30.1 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 4.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (12,20.4,64)
