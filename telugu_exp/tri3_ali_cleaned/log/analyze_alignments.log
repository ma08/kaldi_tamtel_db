The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 21.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 83.4% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 5.8% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 37.9 hours of data, or 29.9 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 4.1% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (13,20.9,66)
