The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 23.9% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 80.6% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 6.1% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 40.1 hours of data, or 30.5 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 4.2% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (13,21.3,67)
