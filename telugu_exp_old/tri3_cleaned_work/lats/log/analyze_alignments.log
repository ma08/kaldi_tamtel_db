The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 23.2% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 81.0% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 5.8% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 40.2 hours of data, or 30.9 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 4.2% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (12,20.1,62)
