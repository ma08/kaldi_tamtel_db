The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 25.5% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 79.9% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 6.8% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 1.6 hours of data, or 1.2 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 4.3% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (4,7.8,26)
