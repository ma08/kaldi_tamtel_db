The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 29.3% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 79.2% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 12.1% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 31.8 hours of data, or 22.5 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 5.2% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (24,33.4,94)
