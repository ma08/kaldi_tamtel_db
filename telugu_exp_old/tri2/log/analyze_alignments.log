The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 24.4% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 80.0% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 6.4% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 40.1 hours of data, or 30.3 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 4.7% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (10,19.8,64)
